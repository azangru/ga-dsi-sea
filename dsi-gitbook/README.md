## Course Value Proposition

This course is designed to give you the deep dive into the world of *Data Science*, focusing on the ability to analyze and convey data-driven facts in order to predict what happens next using modeling and pattern recognition. Our course prepares students to take full-time roles as Data Analysis, Data Scientists, Business Intelligence Analysts, and other roles that require advanced fluency with data. Our projects immerse students in formal data-driven scenarios in order to help them create a polished portfolio of work showcasing their ability to create and communicate machine learning insights.

#### What Our Students Learn

- **Data Analysis & Python**:
 - Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- **Machine Learning & Modeling Techniques**:
 - Explore the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning through the application of various modeling techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering.
- **Git, SQL, & Relational Databases**:
 - Gather, store, and organize your data using the data science toolkit: SQL, Git, and UNIX.
- **Critical Thinking & Synthesis**:
 - Apply your analysis and modeling skills to real world data problems in fields like finance, marketing, and public policy.
- **Visualization, Presentation, & Reporting**:
 - Learn to create reproducible presentations and reports and use data visualisation tools to present your findings to key stakeholders.

#### By the End of This Course, Students Will Be Able To:
- Collect, extract, query, clean, and aggregate data for analysis
- Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- Build, implement, and evaluate data science problems using appropriate machine learning models and algorithms
- Use appropriate data visualization tools to communicate findings
- Present clear and reproducible reports to stakeholders
- Identify big data problems and understand how distributed systems and parallel computing technologies are solving these challenges.
- Apply question, modeling, and validation problem solving processes to datasets from various industries to gain insight into real-world problems and solutions.

## Outcomes

**Beth Miller** and **Casey Hills** will be your outcome coaches for this cohort. They instruct you just the same as your instructional staff; they are who will be helping you get a job.
