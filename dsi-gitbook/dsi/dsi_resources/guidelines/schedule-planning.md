## Schedule Planning

We highly recommend you begin preparing your lessons at least 2-4 weeks before the course starts. During these preparation weeks you should:

- Read through our [Instructor Onboarding materials](../../curriculum/01-instructor-onboarding/) and the [following DSI overview slide deck](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/presentation/d/1ob51BnjcOhpZ6MHTfmwj0Lb0O_8cDtbTsOpcKw4Ikak/edit?usp=sharing)
- Review the high-level unit structure, lesson plans, project arcs, and instructor resources provided.
- Review the objectives as well as sample, starter, and solution code for lessons, labs, and projects.
- Read through our [guide to providing student feedback](../../curriculum/03-projects/project-feedback.md) and review the rubrics for each project.
- Decide how you want to incorporate your experiences into lesson materials and deliverables.
- Create any slide decks needed to correspond with the materials you plan to teach.
  - We recommend using [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) or [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to automatically generate slides from your markdown files or Jupyter notebooks. For more help here, see the [instructions on our DSI Instructor Wiki](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/wiki/Slide-Decks-1:-Apache-Setup-for-Reveal.js)
- Review your students' [required pre-course onboarding tasks](../../curriculum/02-student-onboarding/readme.md), and ask your producer for access to your students' [pre-course onboarding assessment](https://mobilega.typeform.com/to/SOC7S7), which will help you gauge your their initial comfort level with Week 1 materials.
- Review the [onboarding technical guide](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/document/d/10MQB-CR_IQl3-z1HpxGKCrScKb94uj53FvQkssX9KBw/edit?usp=sharing) and prepare to help your students during [Installfest](../curriculum/02-pre-work/installfest-lesson/readme.md).
- Check out the [DSI Instructor Wiki for additional tips and curriculum-related resources](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/wiki/)

> Note: Our goal is to provide you with a content baseline, but please feel free to add or supplement the curriculum with materials based on your own experience and students' comfort level. If you'd like to suggest curriculum revisions, please check out [our contributing guidelines](../../contributing.md).

## Schedule Planning with Trello

1. Use the following link to join the [Baseline DSI Schedule Template](https://trello.com/b/63gtwOro) with your Trello credentials.
2. Log into the [Trello Card Copier](http://trello-bulk-card-mover.herokuapp.com/) using those same Trello credentials. 
3. For "Do You Want to Create A New Board?" select: **YES**
4. Select the *"Data Science Immersive - GA Planning Template"* board
5. For "Old Course Start Date," leave blank or state "June 3rd"
6. For "New Course Start Date", input ***your new course start date***
 - Note: If you are running a "Installfest" prior to the start of class, make sure to start the board on that date.
7. Make sure the bar is set to *"Forward"*
8. Hit "Shift/Duplicate" 

### Using Trello

Use the Trello Card Copier from our Baseline schedule template to set up your own local copy of the Trello board. This includes a custom Calendar view that outlines your daily schedule, as well as a personalized iCalendar feed for specific updates.

You can reset the dates on the cards to reflect your schedule and invite your whole production team as needed. You can even make multiple copies in case you want to make one for planning and one to share the course schedule with your students.

### Navigating Trello
Your Trello board can be viewed by WEEK or by DAY.

- "Default" view groups items and projects for each week.
- "Calendar" view shows specific dates each item will be taught in the pilot.*

#### LABELS
Labels use colors to categorize card types. Labels include:

- Lesson
- Lab
- Project
- Morning Exercise
- Homework
- Flex (instructor choice)
- Resource (linked supplemental materials)
- Tableau (suggested places to leverage Tableau in-class)

#### ASSIGNMENTS
You can "assign" cards to specific members; for instance, if you are dividing teaching responsibilities among multiple instructors. You can filter your view using labels or assignments with the keyboard shortcut "F"

#### MATERIALS
**Morning Exercises**, **Flex Sessions**, and **HW** cards describe aspects of the curriculum that instructors should create and share with the global DSI community. 

- **Morning Exercises**: We recommend that you use this time to review project progress, discuss pain points, conduct polls or surveys, and provide 1:1 feedback.
- **Homework**: We recommend that you leverage material from our lesson assignments, labs, and projects. Many of these materials run long, as they are designed to stretch student competencies and give them additional opportunities to practice the material. Therefore, we suggest assigning materials not finished during class as HW.
- **Flex Sessions**: These are optional sessions provided for topic overflow, review, and supplemental materials. Think of them as chances to further tailor the class to your students' needs. Do they need more review in a concept? Do they want to go more in-depth in a certain topic? Would you like to share additional topics not covered in our curriculum? Use flex sessions for this.
